So I get to the last hill, and the rain is just so heavy its like un-bloody-believable. But sans-car so it's road bike and new clipped pedals..

So, right foot is clipped in, and left is not..

Hit the hill, out of the seat and thump them pedals..

Left foot slips..

and..

locks.

Ok, so both feet clipped in, completely unadjusted pedals..

and all I can think is..

"Please God don't let me do a "Mearso":http://www.mearso.com" - sorry mearso :-(

Panic..

Was the hill this steep yesterday?

Where the hell is my third chain-ring?

Who the hell would buy a bike without one??????

Panic!!
