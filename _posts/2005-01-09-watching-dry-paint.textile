Went to the Turner exhibition this afternoon. Dafydd's been ill all weekend and we really needed to get out of the house. Used to spend a lot of time in art galleries, and it was nice to get some of that feeling back.

I actually ended up missing the Turner part - Dafydd was playing up. But still the calm of the place was quite intoxicating, and when he's feeling better we shall return.
