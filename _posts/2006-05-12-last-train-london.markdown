title: Last train to London
---
Our last trip to London today, no more trips to hospital for Daf. Alas, the reason is more to do with funding then any great breakthrough, but what the heck..

Visited the Apple store on the way back (a true geek) and sat next to some English soccer fans on the train home.

"So the currency in Wales, is it the same or different to England?"
