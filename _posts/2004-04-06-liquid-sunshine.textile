"Megan":http://www.mpet45.co.uk/?c=Megan lots better today, so we've restarted the "Father and Daughter movie club":http://www.mpet45.co.uk/article/541. Today's feature was "The Italian Job":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/ which we managed to watch a whole hour of. It's good. Actually Megan slept - it's a *15* anyway..

Had to leave it to take Dafydd to the Park. Alas, as soon as we parked the car it - as Peter Kay would say - started _Splittin_

So on with Dafydd's coat and we ran to the park, laughing like demented things (which we are). As you can see there was not exactly a crowd there. Ironically, it stopped raining as soon as we got back to the car.
