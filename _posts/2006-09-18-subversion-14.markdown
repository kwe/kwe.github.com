title: Subversion 1.4
---
[Subversion 1.4][1] is out and has some nice new features ([release notes][2]). There's a [webcast][3] of the new features (bit boring). For me the svnsync command looks neat and the Apple keychain support will be very welcome for all those passwords. You can grab a [OSX version pre-compiled][4]. For Windows XP, [TortoiseSVN][5] is a lovely client. On a Mac we tend to use [svnX][6]. Still need persuading? Check out a [free book][7]
