Once again a victory, but Mr Day was very close this time. Starting with style, he parred the first two holes and I was in trouble. My swing was a distant memory and I was struggling to stay in touch. My saviour was the 6th hole. We both tried to hit the same tree and I ended up the right side of it.

Mr Day had to play away from the tree and then disaster struck - or rather his ball hit the tree again. Three down became 5 up and I hung on to win - 52 to 55. 

An improvement over last week, but still pretty poor. Hit three trees and some sand pit.

Must now not play for at least a few months, my golf ability needs a rest...
