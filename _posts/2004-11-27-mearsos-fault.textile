I went and bought a [new camera][1]. |The funky results from the old one were getting a tedious. 

Bought it from Asda. They had an offer on and the photo guy was really helpful and very very into his subject - which is kind of strange for a non-specialist store.

Anyway, now all I need is to figure out how to charge the battery and watch out! more kid pics!
