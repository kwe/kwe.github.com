An appropriate time for a list..

*MUSIC*

My CD of the year goes to "Damien Rice":http://www.damienrice.com/ for "O":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AXKRB/ref=sr_aps_music_1_1/026-3229287-2134844
It has moments for true beauty.

*PLAY*

"Halo":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RHR9/qid=1072896748/br=3-3/br_lfncs_vg_h__3/026-3229287-2134844  the game of the year for me and reason to buy a X-box. Brill game and who can forget the moment when they first came across the _Flood_

*BOOK*

"The Da Vinci Code":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593052447/qid=1072896872/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/026-3229287-2134844 by Dan Brown. Liked the way the action is all set within a single day (very 24) and the hundreds of ideas. Also liked "his other one":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552150738/ref=pd_sim_b_dp_1/026-3229287-2134844

Generally did not read enough..

*FILM*

I "liked it":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000062V91/o/qid=1072897482/sr=2-1/ref=sr_bt_1/026-3229287-2134844 but generally did not see a lot. Wanted to check out Kill Bill and Return of the King, so the choice may well have been different.

*SPORT*

Wales v England (first half). Enough said..

*BIGGEST DISASTER*

Wales v England (second half) and the English winning th World Cup..

*GEEKY*

Anything from "Apple":http://www.apple.com

*WEBSITE*

The "BBC":http://www.bbc.co.uk

*HERO*

Lance and the fifth win.. Probably the sporting moment also..
