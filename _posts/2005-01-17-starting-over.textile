All the changes to [Rails][1] since I wrote my blog software means this is a good time for a rewrite.

So here we go..

This time round ..

* tracebacks
* proper comment system
* xmlrpc support
* tags
* use flickr and del.icio.us for images and links
* caching!

hmm, we'll see..

and on the subject of images - [postcardviewer][2] is neat! [Here's][3] a [local demo][3]

must must have tags !!
