Went to a wedding yesterday and Dafydd did well initally. All was fine until the eveing when the disco lights had a really _really_ *bad* effect. Left quickly, but he was seriously zonked. He (and us) got very scared and a sleepless night followed.

Today, -tried- to chill. Daf seemed ok most of the day, but later on started having problems again. Me, I fell asleep in the beach (in a coat).

On a geekier subject, bluetooth, t68i works great, but eats into battery time...
