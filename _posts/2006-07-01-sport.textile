An end and a beginningSo England once again lose to penalties.  At least now I can stop watching the World Cup. Sadly, the ball is just the wrong shape and I really wanted to enjoy it - but ultimately it proved hard work - Sorry guys!

So I setted down to watch Le Tour and "this happened":http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/5132320.stm - came completely out of the blue for me, I did not see any of the press leading up to this. I actually think it's good for the sport, if people have cheated then lets catch them.
