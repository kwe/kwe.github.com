So you know the recent post where I adopted Vim for editing? Well, like the alpha geek whore I am - I'm now learning emacs.

Blame "peepcode":https://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs as always for the sudden increase in Emacs 'learners'.

So what's cool so far? Definately, the split screen editing, especially with the ability to run things like autotest in a shell split. Put the whole thing full screen and let the coding begin. Git is nicely integrated and even sql queries.

On the bad side it seems to lack some of the shortcuts I really like in textmate ie. c-l for => and ':' tab for :something => something. Perhaps I can add these? hmmm..
