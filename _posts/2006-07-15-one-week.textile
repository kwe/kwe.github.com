title: One Week on
---
a week of Macbook Pro..So, "it":http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro/ finally arrived just over a week ago. 17" of _glowing_ Macbook pro, 2 fat GB of RAM and a glossy screen on top. 

Heck it's a Mac, but with a new trick - it can also run windoze.

Both Boot Camp and Parallels work great - especially parallels which for most things is all that you need. Great for testing those pages on IE.

Of course, just like "this guy":http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/002682.shtml the only real reason someone could want Windows would be to play HL2 etc! I have to admit HL2 is bloody amazing, and while I've not had time for much play recently, myself and Mearso (technical advisor) spent some happy time exploring this sensational game. I picked up Far Cry for &pound; 9 today, so I need to clear some time in my diary!

On the Mac side - the thing just flies. Amazing job to move to Intel so smoothly. For the first time in a while I did not take the option of copying over settings and files from my old Mac - instead I'm installing from scratch.

Django, Rails and friends went on fine and lovely software like Textmate just scream on this thing.

My old white iBook is off to an new owner (sniff) and it's a brave new world..
