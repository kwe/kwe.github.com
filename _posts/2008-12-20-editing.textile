It seems us geeks have a new war to fight. Emacs or Vim!

Take one perfectly good editor (Textmate) and then spend lots of time making older editors behave like it...

So why do it? Seems to me that there is some discomfort with the non-appearence of a Textmate 2.0. This is strange given that 1.0 seems to have sold a lot of Mac's for developers, and been copied by both the e-editor and intouch under Windows.

For me it started with "Jamis":http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim and I guess only really sunk in when he followed up with "this article":http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/11/17/vim-follow-up. 

I downloaded "MacVim":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ and used it for a few days.

So the great stuff is the full-screen mode and the splits. Being able to split the screen into different views is really great for writing tests etc. Kind of hard to go back to Textmate - that's how good it is.

Also very cool is the dbext.vim plugin which gives you lots of SQL goodness right in the editor. No more forgetting db schema's in views.

So, kind of happy with the choice, until "this":http://nubyonrails.com/articles/emacs-emacs. Damn, emacs.

Certainly the intro screencast looks sleak. Autotest within a split *yum*. A full screencast is promised, so stay tuned.
