In an attempt to mediate on the meaningless of existence, I lay down on the decking this evening. A copy of the ActionScript Cookbook as a pillow.

Looking upwards at the cloudless sky I concentrated on life and existence...After some 15 minutes, I was woken by a concerned neighbor and the moment was lost.

At no time did I <em>see</em> Gregg Turner.

<strong>note to Mrs Comley</strong>:

Make sure you keep him away from sharp items and motor vehicles, just until Gregg <em>goes back</em>...
