25 degrees, Big Brother on the tv - it must be Summer.

I just finished watching the "Monastery":http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/monastery/ and have to say I quite enjoyed it. Hardly a hard-hitting program, but certainly one which had depth. Experience more life by experiencing less!?

The beta book - "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/ is turning out to be very good..

So who's my tip to win BB - Maxwell or Sam..
