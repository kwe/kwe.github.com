In the spirit of various month long geeky living articles, I'm trying to live a month using just a laptop. 

_Why_?

I guess I'm getting a little jaded of keeping everything sync'd 

e.g. rubygems, Rails and textmate seems to change weekly and even with svn it's a bit of a bind.

So my beloved iBook (best machine I've ever had - period) will be the machine of choice.

Armed with additions like "Virtue":http://virtuedesktops.sourceforge.net/ and a spanking new Apple wireless mouse I think we will make it!

I've just grabbed the new bbedit 8.1 which has great subversion support - still not enough to abandon textmate tho.
