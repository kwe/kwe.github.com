When I was a student I lived opposite Frank Sinatra.

Living as he did in *UB5somethingOrOther*, he obviously was  not **THE** Frank Sinatra, but nevertheless a Frank Sinatra. I knew this because he played Frank Sinatra very loud at all times of the day or night ( or [Night and Day][2]).

Initially, I thought a blast of AC/DC might help, but alas it just seemed to make it worst.

Finally, I borrowed a copy of a Sinatra album and blasted back, in the hope that it would cancel out the onslaught.

Yup, it worked, he got a girlfriend, became a goth and probably got a good degree and a job in the City.

But anyway...

Recently another Sinatra's caught my attention, [this one][1].

<quote>Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort.</quote>

and crickey it certainly is..

a quick..

<code>
	sudo gem install sinatra
</code>

gets you all the bits you need

then off you go, with a open terminal and the commands..

<code>
	mkdir hello
	cd hello
	mate hello.rb
</code>

into the hello.rb, type..

<code>
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'sinatra'

	get '/' do
		"Hello World"
	end
</code>

All done. Now back to terminal and type..

<code>
	ruby hello.rb
</code>

and point a web browser at http://localhost:4567, and web 3.0 is but an idea away.

Then (if you must) read the [book][3] and do a search on github for 'sinatra' for inspiration. Seems perfect for small projects and you can even host it on apache via [passenger][4].
	
Now off to play some AC/DC..
