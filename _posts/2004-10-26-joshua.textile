The imminent release of "Live Aid":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002UUO9K/qid=1098822688/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-0805509-4475811 and today's "U2 iPod":http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/u2/ started a bout of reminiscing in Evans manor tonight.

Out came the ancient copy of "The Joshua Tree":https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/com.apple.jingle.app.finance.DirectAction/tellAFriend?playlistId=14764574 ripped into iTunes and playing loud. I'd forgotten how good this album is - yes, some stuff since has been good, but as an album this is great!

I remember the day it came out, I even took a day off work. Bought the album early and retired to my digs with two friends - Mr Vodka and Madam Southern Comfort. I'd bought an early CD player a few years earlier with my first pay packet and this CD seemed to spend more of it's time in the player then in the CD case. My father, and hence the whole family, was fighting cancer and this album kind of defined that time for me.

Favorite track for me is _Running to Stand Still_,I love the way it builds from waking up to rage.

bq. Then I floated out of here
Singing Ha La La La De Day

sweet.

Two days later - I rejoined the world..
