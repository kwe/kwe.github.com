"Rails 0.8.0":http://www.rubyonrails.org/show/HomePage is out and looking mighty fine. Especially nice is the new ActiveMailer stuff - email sending made easy.

A quick..
<code>./scripts/new_mailer Notification comment</code>

created most of the code, then
<code>
Notification.deliver_comment(@comment)
</code>

in the comment controller does the trick - instant email notification of new comment posting!
