title: lifeblog + flickr = love

Now that I have a 6630, I can finally use "lifeblog":http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/ 

I'd kind of been toying with the idea of writing a atom connector for typo to allow blogging from lifeblog - when flickr "did it for me":http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008375.html

hmm. need some debugging, but pictures are going to flickr ok, just need to work out why they are not getting to the blog also..
