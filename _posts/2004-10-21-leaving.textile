Flew in last night. Weather is great! Far better then then crap I left behind.

Hotel is super, going for some 'Seawater therapy' later on this evening - well worth the money.

Hired a boat for tomorrow, just going to do some cruising around, sipping champaign and generally _chillin_.

New camera is working fine, so I'll post some more pics later. Hotel has wifi and Sky so I'm sorted.
