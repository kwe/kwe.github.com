Sometimes you get timely reminders of why PC's suck..

Just watch this [keynote][1], and marvel at M$ technology. The really cool thing is that it's not just PCs anymore.

No, now you can easily take digital photos and watch them on you PC (!!!!). 

Let's see a demo Bill!

![One remote][2]

it's not working Bill!!!

![One Button][3]

>"That's the problem when you have the wrong remote control, good thing you only have one though"

_Bill presses the ONE button like a thing possessed_

But Bill's not on his own, the (I assume ex-) head of "Media Center" then comes on and uses another _wrong_ remote (i.e. Bill's) to _do_ his presentation.

hmm..
