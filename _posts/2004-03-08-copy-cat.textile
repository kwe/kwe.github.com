It seems Dafydd's picking up one of my habits. Tea time today, Dafydd and his food went missing! I soon found him easily though - the unmistakable sound of S Club 7 gave him away.

He'd grabbed his food and headed for the study and was settled down watching his Barry Island Movie ("clip":http://homepage.mac.com/kwevans/iMovieTheater12.html). 

Obviously, I'm now going to definitely need a bigger study, so that us men-folk can eat and watch movies in peace!
