<a href="http://kwe.textdrive.com/chess/050309gott/index.htm">Bizarre match last night</a>. A great example of collective mind control - just like <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/M/mindcontrol/">"Derren Brown"</a>

It's move 22 of a game which I've been rather _uninterested_ in. I kind of feel that I'm slowly coming back into the position and certainly the old 'spidey sense' is not going off. Then..

My opponent play 22. .. Qxh2, jumps up and announces,

"It's all over, there's no way out of it - I've won!"

He's very very excited and even goes across the room to fill out the final 'result' on the match card.

Everyone gather's round the board and mumble things like 

"Well played!!!",

Me, I'm in shock..

All I can think is _HOW THE HELL DID I MISS THAT!!_ and the real killer is...

_BLOODY HELL, THIS IS WILL GET PUBLISHED, AND I'LL BE THE IDIOT THAT FELL FOR IT_

So be calm Evans..

Meanwhile he's busy telling people about how he'd planned it since move 17 and generally feeling very happy.

Hmmm..

So I write down '0-1' on my score sheet and try and try and not look embarressed.

_HOW THE F*CK DID I FALL FOR THAT_

is ringing round and round my head.

Ok, Evans grab your stuff and go home

and *then* I notice a look on the face of their first board, and the 'Spidey sense' really does go off..

23. KxQ Rh4 MATE! 

becomes

23. KxQ Rh4 24. Kg3 (win for white)

"Hang on!", I say, "Where's the mate?"

My clock is still clicking, I've not said "I resign" or shaken hands or anything - I was too bloody worried about lossing like that to say anything..

So, anyway then a brief argument about who said what and when. Too tedious, I just offered the guy a draw and went home.

He was massively embarrased, and so was I..

All I could think of was the Derren Brown 'trick' at the dog races where he convinces someone to pay out on losing tickets. So strong was the guy's belief last night that he'd just played a winning combination, that the entire room believed it - almost. 

I certainly was taken in..

I'm off the dog races - speak later..
