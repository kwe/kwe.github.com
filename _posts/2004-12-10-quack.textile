Been a bit of a difficult time recently.

First, Dafydd got ill, and being non-verbal autistic means that as a parent you spend all day worrying about what's wrong and how the hell you can help. Of course not sleeping _helps_!

Then Megs get's ill and a visit to a Doctor becomes one where the word 'Hospital' is mentioned..

So don't get gloomy, because tonight Megs seemed better and while looking at her favorite book - about Ducks- She said(!) 

>"QUACK!"

and then

> "Quack Quack"

So me and Amanda held held her and said "Quack" too, and everything is just completely ok again :-)
