title: even more rails
---
My [Rails][1] _adventure_ continues with lots of changes to this weblog software.

One new feature is a [Mailing list][2] for people without RSS readers.

**ToDo**

* Add [Markdown][3] support, started this by moving text to html conversion to a `:before_save` (DONE)
* Draft post handling needs improving
* xmlrpc stuff for pings and tracebacks
