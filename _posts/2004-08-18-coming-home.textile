Weather is getting me down. Getting home tonight was a bit of a chore. Got to within 1/2 a mile of the house only to find that they'd closed the bridge over the river! At this point the rain started.

I began to think that trying to run over then lone magpie earlier was not a good idea..

So I headed off down the trail next to the river to re-trace the route home. The journey seemed slightly surreal and became even more bizarre when I ran into a couple of what seemed at first to be walking skeletons. They certainly seemed to be the strangest people I've seen in some time, absolutely emaciated - and very scary.

The rain just got worst and worst and by the time I reached the road it was like being in a power shower.

Four extra miles later I got home - the joys of British Summer time.

Not all bad though. Later on watched the first episode of Sopranos series five, and as Tony relaxes by the pool with a gun and a cigar I knew I was home.
