So I'm doing the dishes and singing "The Logical Song":http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=15147671&selectedItemId=15147600 only Jamie (who's 11) starts singing along..

Hmm..

How does she know the song?!

Obviously she's listening to the right music..

Then again "perhaps not":http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=15229118&selectedItemId=15229108

Feel old.
