You Dafydd is ill again, his nose is doing a very good impression of a snot factory and sleep is not coming easy to him (or me). It's been two days since I've seen my bed and I'm thinking of getting a picture done to remind me where it is.

So anyway, at least he's eating - one jar of Vaseline so far ( he found it in his room - Damn!!).

All this lack of sleep means I get to write some code to stay awake. So I've just been testing out Macromedia's newly patched Dreamweaver 2004 7.0.1

I'm happy to report that the thing is vastly improved, especially speed. Will try and use it for a few days..

The fruits of the work are posted to _developing nicely_

Off to dream of electric sheep..
