Made to work quite hard in this one, surprisingly given that I outgraded White by some 600 points. Opening did not help. I managed to play it exactly wrong. The pressure of having to win also made for some tense moments, not quite as bad as [last Wednesday][1]'s scramble but losing the Queen would have been embarrassing...
