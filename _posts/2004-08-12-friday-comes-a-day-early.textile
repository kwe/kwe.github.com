title: friday comes a day early..

It's the 13th tomorrow, but it feels like today! 

Needed to use my new broadband connection in anger for the first time tonight and it was a bit of a disaster.

Initially, all seemed fine. Downloaded some stuff and then got ready to upload to an ftp server. The first few files seemed to work fine, then everything started to just stall.

Restarted router and Mac and tried again.

Now nothing was working. Damn.

Restarted Router again..

Back came the internet and everything was working apart from ftp upload. Tried sftp upload - worked fine.

So I phone the ISP, perhaps ftp server is playing up?!

"No Sir", it's working fine.

Try my Mac again  - oops, no wireless Lan.

Restarted router..

A google search later and it seems my firmware is out-of-date and specifically _problems with ftp upload_ is mentioned.

So time to upgrade..

Seems simple. Connect laptop to router via ethernet and upload the firmware. "*NB* DO NOT INTERRUPT THE UPLOAD - Router will break!!", said the PDF.

So took no chances, running only Safari and ready to go.

"Uploading firmware, DO NOT INTERRUPT"

said the message.

Fine I thought, *no way I'm going to interrupt it!!*

then Safari decides to be helpful...

"No response from site for 60 seconds", says the dialog

"AAAAAAGH"
