title: so that's what a pocket pc is for...
---
My mobile phone found @media 2005 far to exciting and decided to pack-up. Even before Joe Clark tried to use it to _phone home_. Alas I though it's data was lost forever, but a flash of inspiration and a Pocket PC with a MMC slot fixes the missing pics/data problem. 

Anyway, "a few pics":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kwe/tags/media2005/ from the after show party. Boy getting up at 4.30 did not help..
