Yesterday was a trip to Mothercare World in Cardiff. It's ironic that only after all these years of going - Dafydd finally wants to play with all the toys. 

So he's after money for all the kidie rides and trying out all the slides etc. I guess better late then never!

Today it's a trip to Ponty Park (we seem to live there!) and a chance to try out some other rides at the Fair.
