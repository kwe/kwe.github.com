I normally avoid *politics* but..

Spent the morning down the Park with Weekend Dads (WD) and all the other victims of Sports Guilt Tax (SGT).

We all sat around on wet benches watching kids enjoy themselves, silent apart from the occasional shout of 

bq. "Put that Dog down!" and "She does not want to eat sand!"

So not being glum - I've come up with a plan. Vote me into power in the local election and all SGT and WD's will get free beer, fags and betting slips in the Park on Saturday mornings. I'll probably draw the line on recreational drugs, but honestly it depends on the majority I get.
