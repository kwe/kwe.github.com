Some of you may have scoffed at my need for gadgets - ha!

This afternoon we faced a quandary - *food or sand*?

Dafydd wanted to go to the Park, but the cupboards were bare of comfort food!

So...

We went to the park and I did the shopping while we were there, on my new phone!

Those clever people at "Tesco":http://www.tesco.com allow you to shop via the web. What's even better is that the site works out the size of your browser screen and delivers a 'Pocket PC' version that worked just fine on my Nokia.

Case solved - world saved!
