Megan came with me to Tesco's today and caused quite a stir.

Firstly, they opened an paydesk just for us, then someone appeared to help pack and then someone else took the shopping out of the trolly. What service!

Most common question?: 

_How old is She?_

ps> The answer to the "how much sleep" question I've been getting is *10* hours so far - almost 2 hours a day! 

Lovely.

*Update* 8 hours sleep last night! Stunned.
