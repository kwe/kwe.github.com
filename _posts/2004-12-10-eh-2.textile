The [Eh?][1] post refers to the fact that after playing that game I was told I'd played the guy before and lost to him. I kind of normally have a great memory for games and people and so finding someone I did not remember came as a bit of a shock, especially since I was meant to have only played him last year.

Anyway, phoned the guy up to agree a draw and asked him. Mystery solved! I did play him last year and lost - hence forgetting is a defense mechanism!
