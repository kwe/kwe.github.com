Today I finally realised that tv/film watching for me has gone the way of music i.e. something I tend to do on a Mac. Sky+ means I seldom watch anything 'live' these days and the size constraints of my non-160 Sky+ machine means I've been deleting lots recently without even watching it.

So what to do?

Well it seems clear, I need a backup device for Sky+. I initially tried Video, but crickey no way of watching the _backed-up_ stuff anyway. 

So today I bought a DVD recorder.

Out came the credit card and money I do not have changed hands for one new DVD recorder. Tonnes of Betamax/vhs type formats to worry about but my choice had to use DVD-R, because that's what my Mac reads..

A flurry of scart leads later and the thing's all plugged into my _Digital lifestyle_, a test burn at 'standard' play (2hr 15 per DVD-R) and all looks very very good. So tonight my SKY+ will expel some video to DVD-R (on long-play), and I'll be all ready for the new series of **24**.
