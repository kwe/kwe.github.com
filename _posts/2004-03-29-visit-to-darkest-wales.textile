title: visit to darkest wales

Today was 12 years since my Mother died (on Mother's Day and the day before my birthday).

So the enhanced Evans family set out for West Wales armed only with some flowers and fast food money..

First up - refueling.

Dafydd was to busy eating to smile for the camera,

and Meggie is too young to smile - unless it's wind!

Arrived.

The Weather was really hot, summer-like and it seems to have had quite an effect on the local wildlife..

The noise from the fanned out feathers was quite special,

Definitely not a crow..
