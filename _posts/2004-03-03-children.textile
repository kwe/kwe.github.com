Alas no "Megan":http://www.mpet45.co.uk/photo/?album=megan pictures for a few days, Dafydd's been ill, so the camera's been having a rest. A subtle change has occurred in our  language, the word *Children* has appeared. To be honest I've been using *Kids*, but apparently that's something to do with goats..

Poor Megan also has her first nickname, *Puds* (not sure why, Pudding?!), something to do with nappies being full?! It's the lack of sleep.
