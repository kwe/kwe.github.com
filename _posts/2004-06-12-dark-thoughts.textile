!(border)/images/41.jpg (new floor)!

Last night I went to bed at 1am (rebel!). At 4.00am Megs cried and I got up to feed her.

She finally got back to sleep at 8.00am - for a total of 10mins.

DIY started and the world stopped.

As you can see the floor's been anti-moth'd, let's see the buggers chew through that!

Now twelve o'clock approaches and I'm still up, waiting for Dafydd to fall asleep, so I can check he's ok. He's been ill for over a week and needs _care_.

Some silly person said,

"Live each day as if it was your last!"
