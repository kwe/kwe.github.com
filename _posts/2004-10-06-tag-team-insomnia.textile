A lovely game to play and the rules are quite simple..

# get two children
# two sleepy parents

then wait... (that's important), the parents must think they are going to get some sleep..

Now take turns to scream, run around (if mobile) and shout. Again timing is everything, you need to make sure that parent's get back to bed before you restart..
