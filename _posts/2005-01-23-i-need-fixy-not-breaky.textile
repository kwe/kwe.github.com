My iPod is playing up! I guess I removed it without _unmounting_ and now no desktop icon. You can still get at via the command-line, just no icon on the desktop (or anywhere in finder). Given [mearso's adventures][1], I'm sure he'll have the answer!!

__Update__ all better now, just needed to restart the finder for some reason it was ignoring new devices.
