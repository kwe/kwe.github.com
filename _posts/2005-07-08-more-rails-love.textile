Look away now if you can't take any more, it's another "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com love post.

Just discovered a cool new feature - "Migration":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html. This lets you define schema changes to databases easily. Brilliant!

This came in handy today when I needed to add a 'position' column to a table for sliding/swooping ajax goodness

<pre>
class ListReorg < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
		add_column :links, :position, :integer, :default=>0
  end

  def self.down
		remove_column :links, :position
  end
end

</pre>

and all is done..

Oh, and hook your powerbook to the tv and watch "the new rails movie":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/08/new-rails-movie-with-sound-and-sugar/

bliss.
