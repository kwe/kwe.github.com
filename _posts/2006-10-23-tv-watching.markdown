What rocks?Been catching up on some TV lately and what good stuff there's been. Of the new stuff I think [Heroes][1] is very cool and looks really promising, it seemed to start quite slowly, but with episode 4 things really started to click.

Both [Prison Break][2] and [Lost][3] are back and going strong. Prison break ep7 especially good. Lost continues to be dominated by the Others and what or who they are. 

All very good, but the award has to go to good old [Battlestar Galactica][4] - just *fricking* amazing. They promised dark and we got it. Ep3/4 was great TV.

Hey Apple! When can we buy this stuff from iTunes??
