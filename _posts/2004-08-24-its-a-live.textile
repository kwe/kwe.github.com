Fired up my Xbox Live setup this evening for a few hours gaming (wife missing). Setup a game of Rainbow Six 3 and waited..

After a few minutes some players turned up and the games commenced.

Great stuff! Even managed to win a few games! Initially this was more because I did not know the rules i.e. it was last man standing over 5 mins and it took me that long to open a door.

I lack the voice thingy so play silently, though I did get a heck of a shock when someone coughed _behind me_, just before he shot me.
