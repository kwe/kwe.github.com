First game of golf in some 10 months went quite well. Still think it's a bit of a waste of a nice walk. Managed to come second in my group (in front of Tony and John Beech).

Final score a 105 on a tough course. New 3 wood was fine apart from the first hole. Ball squeezed left a whole 10 foot - right in front of the club house - *Ops*

*Here's John in action!*
