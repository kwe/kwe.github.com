Managed to sneak on-line with Halo 2 last/this evening/morning. Quite an experience, Xbox live is really busy right now with Halo 2.

On clever bit is that [Bungie][1] publish rss feeds for each play. Mine are [here][2]. Five games and sadly no wins - although I did progress to level 2 (whatever that means?!).

The [detail][3] is just amazing!!!
