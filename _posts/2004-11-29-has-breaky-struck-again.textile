title: has breaky struck again?
---
Mearso is getting a bit of a [reputation][1] and I'm afraid I'm about the add to it [again][2]. I'll admit it's a little tenuous, but Dafydd's body clock is broken and I need someone to blame.

He's not sleeping till late and then wakes up in the middle of the night **ready** to go. Hmm, perhaps it's not you Mearso, but I'm watching!!!

ps> Cycling down the Taff Trail in the dark is fine, but..

1. Don't think about Vampires
2. Don't crash when you run into another cyclist coming in the opposite direction - even if he has no lights on..

*Damn* did both.
