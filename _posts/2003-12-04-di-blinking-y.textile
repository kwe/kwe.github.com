A night wasted on DIY :-(
Firstly the construction of a flat-packed sink thingy (note technical language). A chance to saw out a piece of wood without a proper saw (<strong>joy!</strong>).

Then as _desert_ a little bit of motor mechanics. Took the front of the car off in an attempt to get at the light fitting. Lots of bits..

Lucky the guy next door works in a garage. Seems you have to take the wing off to get at the blinking (!) light bulb. Put it all back together, but found that I had one bolt to many. Time to take it apart again..

Finally, yet more DIY -
