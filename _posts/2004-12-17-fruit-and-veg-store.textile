While in London yesterday, me and Daf went on a very brief visit to the new [Apple Store][1]. Very impressive. The place was crowded out and the queues to pay for stuff were of Disney proportions!

Now it would be terribly sad to have taken pictures of a shop, but unfortunately my camera on the phone is playing up and seems to have snapped some (?!)..

The theater bit was packed out and lots of people were getting help on the Genius Bar. In the video section people were getting video editing tips and the iPod section was full on shelves of iPod's which were rapidly disappearing.

Downstairs there was a G5 with two 32" displays - a must have!
