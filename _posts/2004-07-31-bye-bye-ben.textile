"Ben's":http://www.babyatom.com/bigblog.html last day yesterday, so we all went to the Ottley. Nice to catch up with everyone.

Jenny came along and a certain French looking Chewie.

Good time, only spoilt by having to walk all the way home. Can't get a taxi anywhere. Very sore feet this morning..
