Managed to escape to the movies and saw "Collateral":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369339/ 

Tom Cruise gets to be the _bad guy_ for a change in an action thriller that makes you think a bit more then normal. Michael Mann directs "in your face", but with just enough of his trademark cuts to remind you who the Director is.

Good movie. Felt ill all day, so if I'd not booked in advance would probably have missed it, which would have been a shame.
