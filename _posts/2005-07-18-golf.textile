<p>So it's that time of year again - the annual golf challenge.<br />
<br />
Young Mr Day continues to 'cheat' by having lessons and my 247 days since I last played did little to improve my game.<br />
<br />
It all came down to hole 18 and after a titanic battle I won 121-123.<br />
<br />
Generally, the course won. A few holes were just too hard for us and we leaked shots (and balls).</p>
