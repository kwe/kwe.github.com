A movie weekend. First up was [iRobot][1] on DVD. Not bad, but also far from good. Effects are great and the central idea is sound, just the execution that goes wrong. Looks like lots of stuff ended up on the cutting room floor..

The 'chick flick' [Bridget Jones 2][2], definitely "the edge of reason". Fine in a fluffy light weight sort of way, just lacked a focused plot. Seemed more of a celebration of the first one..
