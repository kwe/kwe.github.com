Eleven years ago my Father died on this day. Kind of been a shit day, and I need an outlet. There's only two things anyone needs to know about death - firstly, you always feel guilty and secondly it's far too easy to die. We kind of kid ourselves that we're pretty robust but it just kind of sneaks up on you. He'd been ill for a few days with a heavy cold and given the fact that his lungs were f*cked from years of smoking he decided to not take his medication that night.

Instead, it seemed like a really good idea to stay awake. Sitting in a chair next to the kitchen table, with the door open - 'to let in some air'. I try not to imagine how many hours he spend that night gasping for air. His medication he'd put away in another room and I guess there came a point when he just would not have been able to reach it even if he tried.

So guilt comes from not being there - from assuming that a grown man would not gamble with life so, which is where the second truth about life and death comes from.

Cheers Dad. Today your forty year old son, had a shit day arguing over &pound;24 quid, had an evening of trying to calm down a disabled son and will shortly have a night of 'gasping' for breath.
