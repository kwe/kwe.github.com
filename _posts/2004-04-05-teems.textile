Well I guess it had to happen..

Ended up taking Megan to Teems tonight. She's been unwell for a few days, with a rash and a temperature. Doc said rash was causing a problem, but that it should clear by itself - just give her calpol. Went to Tesco on the way back and they refused to sell Calpol for such a young baby - "Get a prescription!"

Anyway the whole things was familiar, yet different. Dafydd came with us and was visibly shocked that the Doc did not want to see him! (me too I guess). I even started to give his date of birth to the Doctor on the phone, must have sounded strange.

tired.
