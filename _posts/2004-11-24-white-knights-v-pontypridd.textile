Bit of an epic from the Welsh knock out cup. Played in Llanelli, which was great to visit again after quite some time.

The game itself was quite a tussle with a tricky Rook v pawns ending. Probably quite easy, but in time trouble I made a bit of a meal of it. Game ended in a flurry of unrecorded moves, but overall a nice win.
