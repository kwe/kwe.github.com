It came yesterday, but alas Dafydd had a rough night so just picking it up now. Looks really good, with a nice reference section.

My Zeldman did not arrive :-( but in a bizarre twist a lot of Amazon books for Amanda did arrive. Even though they were on a 3-5 day delivery and were only shipped yesterday...
