title: you know if you've got it bad when ..

.. you are in a meeting and someone mentions the need for online staff CV's. And instead of taking notes you find yourself starting up [CocoaSQL][1] and adding some fields. And then before you can stop, the shaking starts and up comes [iTerm][2] and 

<code>rails ~/Sites/cv</code>.

Then it gets worst..

<code>cd ~/Sites/cv</code>

<code>script/generate model Person</code>

<code>script/generate controller People</code>

<code>script/generate scaffold Person</code>

and before you can stop yourself..

<code>script/server</code>

and the bloody things' up and running - a working _database driven staff CV_ - Damn.

Haven't even run [Textmate][4] yet to add some corporate css...

__see__ if I'd just become an Accountant it would all be so much easier..

None of this [new damn magic][5] to play with..
