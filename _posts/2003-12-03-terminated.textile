<a title="Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181852/">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)</a>. Ok. Not really sure that the series needed another film and for the first half-hour it seems to be a satire of Terminator 2. Still some good stunts, lots of chasing - just seems a little tired.

The only really good bit was the way they used to the current virus problems to explain how Skynet takes over.
