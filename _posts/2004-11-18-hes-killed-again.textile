title: he's killed again!
---
[He may have confessed][1] but he's done it again! Earlier on, in work Mearso picked up my cycle light and switched it on!!! (pause for dramatic effect)

This same _light_ decided the fail on the way home. And boy did it choose it's time.

Even though I'd decided that cycling down the Taff Trail in the dark is "a very silly thing" and even though I thought "I was actually having a lift home tonight", I ended up cycling down the Taff Trail in the *dark* again.

Just at the point of maximum scariness - the one where I was just thinking, " this is a bloody silly idea" - the light flickered and went out.

_Oops_

Just me and the rain (did I mention the driving rain)..

Anyway, any previous use of the word __Dark__ should be laughed at. Boy, was it __DARK__

So [Mearso][2]! confess and get it over with!
