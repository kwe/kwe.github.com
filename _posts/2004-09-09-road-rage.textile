Had a stupid, silly time getting home tonight on the bike. Going through Treforest a car almost knocked me off the road. 

A car full of yobs was the problem. The guy in the passenger seat decided it would be 'funny' if he lunged out at my handlebars as they went past. It was a warm afternoon and they had all the windows down in the car.

It really shocked me this time. I've put up with a fair amount of abuse for 'daring' to cycle in this area over the years, but this one shook me up. I guess I just did not expect anyone to be so bloody silly.

Now I'm just pissed off, and frankly feel I've had enough of this sh*t hole.
