title: dynamic vhosts working..
---
So I finally got this to work..

created a table called a _accounts_ which includes a field of _subdomain_ and added two rows, one with a sudomain of 'kwe' and another with a subdomain of 'fred'.

Then the bit that took a while..

<code>sudo vi /etc/hosts</code>

and added two test domains..

`127.0.0.1   kwe.multi.mine`

`127.0.0.1   fred.multi.mine`

Then

<code>sudo vi /etc/httpd/httpd.conf</code>

and added a vhost with an <code>ServerName *.multi.mine</code>

now for the code..

In _application.rb_

`before_filter do |c| `

`c.account = Account.find_by_subdomain(c.request.subdomains.first)`

`end`	

and then created a sample controller ( I called it test) which looked like..

<code>
class TestController < ApplicationController
	
attr_writer :account

	def index
		render_text "Hello World "+ @account['subdomain'].to_s
	end
end
</code>

and it all works!
