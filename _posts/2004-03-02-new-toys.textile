My _study_ stinks. Not in the smelly sense, but in the space sense. For the last few weeks there's been some much junk everywhere that I've ended up squeezing the keyboard and mouse into an increasing mess of wires and unhappiness. 

Good excuse for a trip to the Apple store and a few moments latter I've got a shiny new Bluetooth wireless keyboard. Looks and works like magic and you can even type on you lap (hoooray!) - I *need* to get out more.

Can't have a keyboard without a mouse, so time to get a Logitech MX700 wireless mouse.

both work great, now I just need to make some room for other stuff. Perhaps I can get away with knocking down the wall into the dinning room - have to do it quietly..
