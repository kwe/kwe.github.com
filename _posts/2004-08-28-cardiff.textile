Went shopping in Cardiff for the first time in quite a while. With a mission I picked up an "interpol":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BTCA/pd_ka_0/026-6834636-4943658 CD (first no iTunes purchase in a long time). Some "Hellboy":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1840235373/qid=1093896059/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-6834636-4943658 and finally with money that's not mine, a Xbox Live microphone thingy (!).

Proceeded to play a late night game of 'shoot people' on Xbox Live again a drunk Scot, an apologetic Englishman, a 'rather good' American and a enigmatic Dutch guy.

I said nothing.
