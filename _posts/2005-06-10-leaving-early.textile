On the train back from @media 2005 early. Unfortunately have to miss the second day because of a health scare at home. Megs was in contact with a child that has developed meningitis and I need to get home to decide if she needs to be given some anti-biotics just in case.

On a brighter note, the conference was great and got to meet lots of famous geeky designers in the evening. And of course hang out with the mighty mearso who was quite a celebrity himself!
