Once more we are the _House of Pain_. Both children have bad colds and Amanda's also now got it. Dafydd has once again adopted the autistic solution to his runny nose and rubbed the thing so many times that his face is bleeding. Looks like he's been in the ring with Tyson. His mood also reminds one of Tyson right now.

I thought it was meant to be Summer (soon)?
