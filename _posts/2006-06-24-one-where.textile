They start selling _books_!!!Well, it seems I can no longer plan for my retirement bookshop in the valleys. "Borders":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kwe/173964342/ has finally opened and there's suddenly a bookshop for the masses - that doesn't have the word 'Bargain' in the title.

It's quite a shock and I'm sure the locals will try and burn it down at some point.
