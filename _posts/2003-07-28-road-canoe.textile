Bit of a travel crisis today. Firstly, choose my mountain bike, only to find that the back wheel seems buckled. Certainly the brake was catching in a major.

So back up the hill to get the road bike. All went well until home time...

The heavens decided to open and I got amazingly wet (no coat!!). At times I truly felt that a canoe would have been a better choice...
