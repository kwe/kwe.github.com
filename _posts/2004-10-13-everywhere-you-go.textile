Always take your "Instiki":http://www.instiki.org/show/HomePage with you..

Since it is a great system for _Remembering_ things - "Why not have it available both at home and at work?", I thought.

the only problem seemed to be that it saved it's database to ~/Library/Application Support/Instiki

So I copied that directory to my iDisk and linked the old location to the new one with a 

<code>ln -s /Volumes/iDisk/Documents/Instiki Instiki
</code>

It's probably a good idea to stop Instiki running before you switch locations..
