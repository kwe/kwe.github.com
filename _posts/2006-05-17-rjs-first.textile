title: RJS first
---
Actually used rjs finally in Rails today. 

Been struggling to find an excuse to do some ajax and rjs seems so neat - it just had to be done..

"Delegate list":http://gregynog.glam.ac.uk/institutions/list for the Gregynog site. Took a little while to figure it out, but in the end it was very little code..

{% highlight ruby %}
page[@list].replace_html :partial => 'institution_list', :collection => @delegates.people
page[@list].show
page[@list].visual_effect :highlight
{% endhighlight %}


Need to find some good documentation on this stuff. *Update*, "found it":http://www.rubyinside.com/16-rjs-resources-and-tutorials-for-rails-programmers-5.html

In other rails related news, "Corked":http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/05/17/corkd.html perhaps a site that Chewie will like. Mr Hivelogic "says it best":http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/05/17/corkd
