Went to see his live show this evening in Cardiff. Very very very good and completely *WOW*.

I kind of expected the live show to be _safer_ somehow, but kept getting the impression that there was quite a high risk involved in the tricks i.e. things could just go badly wrong. Some of the stuff did go wrong, but he was very good at making it seem part of the show - then again perhaps it was!

Encore was a video of the actual show highlighting how all the tricks led to the last one... hmmm

*bloody clever* guy.
