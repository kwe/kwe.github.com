title: Come back XP all is forgiven
---
If only I could find the damn disk..For the last two (ish) days I've been [running Vista pre-RC1 on my Macbook Pro][1].

Heck it seemed like a good idea..

_Shiny graphics_ and the such.

Feels a hell of a lot like OSX, which is nice for our suffering majority of computer users.

**Then**

I'm reminded of why I switched...

Drivers that do not work (no sound!!) and more importantly Half-life 2 which refuses to run, even when the most people say it should. Yes it's a beta (I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW)..

Time to crawl for an XP disk..
