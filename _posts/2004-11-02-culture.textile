> Methought I heard a voice cry, ?¢??Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep!?¢?? the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell?¢??d sleave of care,
The death of each day?¢??s life, sore labour?¢??s bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature?¢??s second course,
Chief nourisher in life?¢??s feast. 

Which explains my my *mind hurts* right now!
