It E3 time and M$ announce "Halo 3":http://www.bungie.net/Games/Halo3/ for XBOX360. Something to look forward to, especially how it evolves for the new generation hardware.

Meanwhile, the Sony PS3 looks expensive, with a lame controller idea, _copied_ badly from Wii (who the hell came up with that name)..
