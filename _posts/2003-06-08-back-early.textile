Hols cancelled early. Daf not really up to it. He found it hard to get to sleep on Friday night, it was eventually 3.00am by the time he fell asleep. Lots of screaming in a caravan - not nice.

The reason became clear in the morning. It was like a scene from the Godfather, only without the horse head. It seems he managed to bite down on the blood clot in his mouth, hence his distress.

There was blood everywhere and Amanda was very faint. Mobiles did not work, so I ended up driving to Carmarthen Hospital.

We must be going for some type of record regarding the number of such establishments we can visit in one month. This one is looking a little old and has bad memories for me.

Anyway, we decided to come home - enough adventure for one year...
