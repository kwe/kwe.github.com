Off work today with very very sore mouth after a bad reaction to some medication. So time for a little project...

I'd got a 2 month 'free' Xbox live offer which was running out shortly so decided to have a go at joining. Of course the biggest problem is that the router is no where near the Xbox, but with all this wireless stuff around I was sure there must be a way.

First up was the idea of using the Powerbook, a cross-over cable and 'internet sharing' under OSX.

_No cigar!_

Strangely it just did not work. From looking at the forums it looks like some changes in 10.3 may cause this..

Ok, plan B

A PC laptop, cross-over cable and ICS (internet connection sharing).

Initially things looked easy, but the stupid PC keeps 'forgetting' about the wireless lan. ICS was also a pain because it insisted on allocating IP numbers that already existed on the LAN to the Xbox.

So in typical M$ fashion the fix is to change everything else - since it seems you can't easily change the way ICS allocates numbers. So reconfigure the router, its firewall and all the Macs and *Hooray* - it works!

Now for some gaming!

(Sadly all this fiddling seems to have used up all my gaming time)
