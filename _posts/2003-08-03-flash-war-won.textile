title: flash war won!
---
My weekend campaign against Macromedia Flash sems to have ended in victory. The Advert/slides/events program is beaten! For a demo(<a title="recentXML" href="http://www.welshrugbypics.co.uk/recentXML.html">Super slides</a>).

This thing almost had me beat, I was on the ropes and reaching for my css book...

So to recap....

# grab a list of events/adverts/slides from a db
# format as "xml":http://www.welshrugbypics.co.uk/mainEventsXML.php"
# each has a potential for things like background colour and duration
# grab them into flash and shuffle them to randomise the show
# load an image (with progress bar)
# load another image (off screen).
# scroll the display when the second image finishes loading
# repeat until sick

This is rewrite number 3 and it better be right!
