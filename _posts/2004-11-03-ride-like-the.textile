title: ride like the..
---
Late leaving work tonight, and I needed to get home quickly, **so..**

Decided not to _play with the traffic_ (like normal), instead my fevered brain thought that perhaps what I needed to do was ride home down the Taf Trail - in the _err_ **DARK**.

As soon as I joined the trail I realised the folly of my plan.

The darkness just _swallowed_ me and reality seemed to melt away. My puny little cycle light seemed completely ineffectual and the familiar trail seemed to have morphed into something far more sinister.

Faster and faster I went, all the time I felt the unseen presence on my shoulder. It became really hard to work out just how fast I was going, with nothing to reference against. All I know is that I rode like a thing possessed and sore legs will follow.

Eventually, I emerged blinking into the light and home.

Bloody hell!

I think I'll do it every night!
