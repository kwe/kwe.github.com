	<p>What rocks?Been catching up on some TV lately and what good stuff there's been. Of the new stuff I think <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> is very cool and looks really promising, it seemed to start quite slowly, but with episode 4 things really started to click.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/">Prison Break</a> and <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a> are back and going strong. Prison break ep7 especially good. Lost continues to be dominated by the Others and what or who they are. </p>

<p>All very good, but the award has to go to good old <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> - just <em>fricking</em> amazing. They promised dark and we got it. Ep3/4 was great TV.</p>

<p>Hey Apple! When can we buy this stuff from iTunes??</p>
