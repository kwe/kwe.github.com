	<p>a week of Macbook Pro..So, "it":http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro/ finally arrived just over a week ago. 17" of <em>glowing</em> Macbook pro, 2 fat GB of RAM and a glossy screen on top. </p>

<p>Heck it's a Mac, but with a new trick - it can also run windoze.</p>

<p>Both Boot Camp and Parallels work great - especially parallels which for most things is all that you need. Great for testing those pages on IE.</p>

<p>Of course, just like "this guy":http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/002682.shtml the only real reason someone could want Windows would be to play HL2 etc! I have to admit HL2 is bloody amazing, and while I've not had time for much play recently, myself and Mearso (technical advisor) spent some happy time exploring this sensational game. I picked up Far Cry for &pound; 9 today, so I need to clear some time in my diary!</p>

<p>On the Mac side - the thing just flies. Amazing job to move to Intel so smoothly. For the first time in a while I did not take the option of copying over settings and files from my old Mac - instead I'm installing from scratch.</p>

<p>Django, Rails and friends went on fine and lovely software like Textmate just scream on this thing.</p>

<p>My old white iBook is off to an new owner (sniff) and it's a brave new world..</p>
